## 1. Introduction

**Facial Expression Detection** is a machine learning project designed to classify facial expressions from images into categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc., using deep learning techniques. This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to detect and classify facial expressions from a given dataset.

### Key Features:
- Use of deep learning for facial expression detection.
- Implements CNN with layers like Convolution, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense.
- Uses Keras utilities and TensorFlow for training the model.
