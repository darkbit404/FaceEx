# FaceEx
## 1. Introduction

**Facial Expression Detection** is a machine learning project designed to classify facial expressions from images into categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc., using deep learning techniques. This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to detect and classify facial expressions from a given dataset.

### Key Features:
- Use of deep learning for facial expression detection.
- Implements CNN with layers like Convolution, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense.
- Uses Keras utilities and TensorFlow for training the model.

## 4. Dataset

The project requires a dataset containing facial images and their corresponding expression labels (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc). You can use a public dataset like [Facial Expression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadityasinghal/facial-expression-dataset) or any other dataset.

Download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
Ensure the structure of the dataset is as follows:
```bash
data/
├── train/
│   ├── angry/
│   ├── disgust/
│   ├── fear/
│   ├── happy/
|   ├── neutral/
|   ├── sad/
|   ├── surprise/
└── test/
    ├── angry/
    ├── disgust/
    ├── fear/
    ├── happy/
    ├── neutral/
    ├── sad/
    ├── surprise/
```
